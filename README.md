# Food Inflation Analysis 
## (2020–2023)

---

## Project Overview

This repository accompanies a Tableau dashboard exploring the drivers behind U.S. food inflation from 2020 to 2023.  
The project examines whether rising grocery prices were caused more by global supply disruptions (imports) or domestic economic factors (interest rates, retail markups).

---

## Tools Used
- Python (for preprocessing)
- Excel (data cleaning)
- Tableau Public (data visualization)
- GitHub (project versioning and portfolio)

---

## Key Objectives
- Identify major trends in food inflation between 2020–2023

- Visualize and compare category-specific inflation rates

- Highlight geographic or category-specific outliers and patterns

## Limitations

- Some public datasets used may have time lags  
- Does not include real-time tariff data or producer contracts  
- Imports analyzed in percentage terms, not absolute volumes

---

## Next Steps

- Integrate real-time pricing APIs  
- Add retail scanner data for price comparisons  
- Explore labor and climate-related cost drivers

## Key Findings
- **Imports stayed flat**, while grocery prices surged.
- Categories like **processed and fresh foods** saw the highest retail markups.
- **Interest rates and CPI** rose together — macroeconomic factors were tightly linked to food inflation.
- **Fruits, vegetables, and meats** made up the majority of U.S. imports year after year, with little shift in mix.
